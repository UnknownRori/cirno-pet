Cirno Pet is funny project, the idea is coming from FL Studio plugins called fruity dance and someone made Cirno Fumo spinning dance for it, 
so I made one that doesnt require FL Studio. so who Cirno by the way? it's character from Touhou Project.

### About Touhou Project

Touhou Project is an indie game series (also known as "doujin" in Japanese)
known for its ensemble cast of characters and memorable soundtracks.
It is produced by and large by a single artist known as ZUN, and has a
[permissive license](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki:Copyrights#Copyright_status.2FTerms_of_Use_of_the_Touhou_Project>)
which allows for indie derivative works such as Kurai Project to legally exist.

Kurai Project is *not* a "clone" of Touhou Project, and tells an original story with its own
music, art, gameplay mechanics, and codebase. While some familiarity with Touhou
is helpful, the gameplay can be enjoyed on its own without prior knowledge of
the series.
